# Data collection

Once the [source codes from LORE](source_codes.md) have been obtained and their [parameters](parameters_generation.md) have been generated, all programs need to be executed to gather data from [performance counters](performance_counters.md) using PAPI.

The programs are executed in batch. Running each several times is recommended for more precise results.
